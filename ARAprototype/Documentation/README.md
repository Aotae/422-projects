Our Software can be decomposed into 3 major components the GUI, The BOOK/NOTE SERVER and the BOOK/NOTE Database. It can be further decomposed to find 2 minor subcomponents of the B/N Database The Book Collection and Note Collection. On a slightly higher layer of abstraction our software follows a Client-Server Model.
